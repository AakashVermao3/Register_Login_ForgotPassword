-----------------Api integriation and it importancte and what is Post man ------------
=> APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are crucial in modern software development 
   as they allow different software systems to communicate with each other. An API acts 
   as a bridge between different applications, enabling them to share data and perform 
   operations. Here’s an overview of API modules and the importance of testing APIs 
   using a tool like Postman:
1. API Modules :
            *API modules are essentially building blocks or components of an API. 
             These modules are responsible for specific tasks, such as handling requests, 
             processing data, and returning responses.
            *Each module is designed to perform specific functions, like CRUD operations
             (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources (like user data, product information, etc.). 

2. Importance of API Modules:
          *Modularity: Dividing an API into modules helps keep the code organized and manageable,
           making it easier to troubleshoot and scale.              
          *Reusability: API modules allow code to be reused across different parts of the 
           application or even across multiple projects.
          *Security: Separating sensitive functionality into specific modules, such as 
           authentication, enhances the API’s security.

3. Postman Platform:
          *Postman is a popular platform used for testing and developing APIs. It provides a 
           user-friendly interface for sending API requests and inspecting responses without 
           needing to write code.
          *It supports a variety of HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and allows 
           users to create collections to organize API tests.

4. Testing APIs with Postman: 
          *Creating Requests: In Postman, you can create and send HTTP requests to test how 
           an API responds. You can set the request type (GET, POST, etc.), add parameters, 
           headers, and body content.            
          *Testing Responses: Postman provides detailed response information, including 
           status codes, response time, headers, and the response body, allowing you to 
           validate the API’s behavior.

5. Importance of API Testing with Postman:
          *Ensures Functionality: By testing APIs, you verify that all API endpoints work
           as expected and return the correct responses for different inputs.
          *Identifies Bugs Early: Testing helps identify issues such as incorrect data 
           handling, security vulnerabilities, or unexpected responses before they reach production.

--------------:Now Sreps to create this project:--------------------------------
Step 1: Create a Project File Structure:
      
      => registration-app/
            ├── backend/
            │   ├── config/
            │   ├── models/
            │   ├── routes/
            │   ├── controllers/
            │   ├── server.js
            ├── frontend/
            │   ├── public/
            │   │   ├── css/
            │   │   ├── js/
            │   ├── views/
            │   │   ├── register.html
            │   │   ├── login.html
            │   │   └── forgotpassword.html
            ├── .env
            ├── package.json
            └── README.md

Step 2: Create an .env file for the port no and you mongDB conetivity
      => MONGO_URI="your mongo url "
         PORT=3000

Step 3: Create your monogoDB conectivity linkn 
Step 4: Now paste or create the whole code as i write
Step 6: Now make sure that you in the same director as per your project file name in my cas register_api_prac
Step 6: Now run node backend/server.js
